# 🩺 Support Vector Machine (SVM)-Based Diabetes Detection

The proposed project will involve estimated risks of diabetes among patients using diagnostic measurements. It applies a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier in lying out a binary classification on the Pima Indians Diabetes data set.

The implementation guides to the core basics of a common machine learning process - starting with data preparation and feature extraction, followed by training, testing and evaluating a model and its performance. It assisted in buttressing some principles of supervised learning and model identification.
